broadcast-utils
===============

Collection of scripts for managing Outernet content repository.

Prerequisites
=============

The following command line tools are required:

- zip
- unzip
- zipinfo
- md5sum

Python should also be installed.

Naming conventions
==================

All scripts have a .sh extension. Files that contain 'util' in their name are
library modules that should be ``source``d into other scripts rather than used
directly.
